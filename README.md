A 2D game made with Unity with C# scripting. Your task is to save the enchanted forest from a bad sorcerer. You have to kill lots of monsters on your way. This is a typical platformer game. You jump from platform to platform, collect items, shoot monsters, avoid bombs and poison, move toward the door to the next level. Some of the platforms can move, which makes the game more difficult.

## Story 

Forest Monsters is a 2D platformer game. The goal of the game is to defeat the sorcerer who cast a spell on a cheerful forest, turning it into an abominable place. But first you have to defeat the numerous forest monsters that protect him.

Before you even have the opportunity to meet the sorcerer, you have to venture through nine levels of the game. Finally, in the tenth level, after you manage to defeat all or most of the monsters, you’ll have the opportunity to fight against the sorcerer himself. 

There are a couple types of monsters. Some can move, others stay put. Some shoot at you, others don’t. But you can shoot at them too, as long as you have ammunition. If you run out of your ammo, you can’t shoot anymore until you find and collect some ammo. There are some useful collectibles scattered all around the place. Besides ammo, you can find poison that will slow you down or a power drink that will power you up for a while. If you find a shield, you’ll be protected from the monsters’ shots for some time. You can even become invisible to the monsters provided you find an invisibility cloak. On your way you will lose health each time you can shot. Also watch out for bombs, they’ll cost you a lot of life too. But if you find a first aid kit, you’ll recover. There’s also a crystal ball that will help you find the sorcerer. 

## Gameplay 

In each level the player will move from the starting position, which is different in each level, toward the door that leads to the next level. In order to open the door, you’ll need a key, so you must find it first. The player moves on platforms of differing lengths and mobility. Some platform never move, others move all the time. There are also platforms that only start moving when the player jumps onto them. Anyway, the player must jump from platform to platform, killing the monsters and collecting or avoiding different object on the way. You must also be careful to not fall off a platform because if this happens and there is no other platform below, you’ll lose the level and have to start it over. You don’t have to kill all the monsters, but the more the better. A higher score will come in handy in the last level when you meet the sorcerer. The more you score throughout the game, the more chances you will get in level 10 to kill the sorcerer. If you manage to kill the sorcerer before your last chance is used up, you will save the forest. Otherwise you’ll lose and the sorcerer will win.

## The Player 

The player character will be able to move in horizontal direction, always facing the direction of movement. They will also be able to jump and even double-jump. If the player falls down to the forest floor, they die and the scene is restarted. The camera follows the player all the time. 

## The Props 

The player can interact with several kinds of props that are scattered around the scene. These include:

- Ammo - it lets the Player regain their full amount of ammo,- Bomb - it takes some health away, more than a bullet

- Crystal Ball - it makes the Sorcerer visible,

- First Aid Kit - it lets the Player fully recover,

- Invisibility Cloak - it makes the Player invisible to monsters, so they don’t shoot, but they can still bump into the Player,

- Poison - it slows the Player down,

- Power Drink - it powers up the Player so that they can shoot more powerful bullets,

- Shield - it protects the Player from the monsters’ bullets,

- Key - the Player needs it to open the door and go to the next level,

- Door - it leads to the next level.

Some props are hard to see, so you must be careful.
