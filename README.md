# forest-monsters

A 2D game made with Unity with C# scripting. Your task is to save the enchanted forest from a bad sorcerer. You have to kill lots of monsters on your way. This is a typical platformer game. You jump from platform to platform, collect items, shoot monsters, avoid bombs and poison, move toward the door to the next level. Some of the platforms can move, which makes the game more difficult.
